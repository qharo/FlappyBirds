# Flappy Birds using NEAT

This repository hosts a Flappy Bird clone developed in Python, utilizing the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm to train a neural network for playing the game autonomously.

## Structure

- **images/**: Contains images used in the game.
- **Lib/site-packages/**: Python libraries and site-packages.
- **Scripts/**: Script files for setting up the environment.
- **ENV.py, UI.py, controller.py**: Python scripts for the game environment, user interface, and game control logic.
- **config-feedforward.txt**: Configuration file for the NEAT algorithm.
- **bestNN.txt**: Stores data about the best-performing neural network.

## Library Used
- **NEAT-Python**: Library for implementing the NEAT algorithm.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up the virtual environment and install dependencies.
3. Execute `controller.py` to start the game and see the AI play.
